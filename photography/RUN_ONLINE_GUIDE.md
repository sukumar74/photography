# How to Run Without Installing ANYTHING (Zero-Setup)

Since you don't have Node.js installed, the easiest way is to run the app **Online**. It works exactly like a real website and is completely free.

## The "Drag & Drop" Method (StackBlitz)

1.  **Open this website**: [stackblitz.com/fork/vite-react](https://stackblitz.com/fork/vite-react)
    *   This opens a ready-made React environment in your browser.
2.  **Delete the existing files**:
    *   In the "Files" list on the left, delete the default `src` folder and `App.jsx`.
3.  **Drag and Drop**:
    *   Open your folder `f:\practical way of learning\web development\photography` on your computer.
    *   **Drag** the `src` folder, `package.json`, `index.html`, and `vite.config.js` **from your computer into the StackBlitz file list**.
4.  **Automatic Install**:
    *   StackBlitz will see the files and automatically install the "ingredients" (dependencies).
    *   It might ask "Run this project?" -> Click **Yes**.
5.  **Done!**
    *   You will see the "Creative Studio" appear in the preview window on the right.
    *   There is a URL at the top (like `https://vite-react-xyz.stackblitz.io`). **Send that link to your brother**. He can use it immediately!

## Why this is great
*   **No installation** on your computer.
*   **Free hosting** included.
*   **Edit anytime**: You can change the "Effects" in the browser and it updates instantly.
